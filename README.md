# pause-on-lock
Simple script that pauses your music player, when the screen gets locked and
resumes playback once the screen is unlocked again.

### Supported desktop environments
Currently [Unity](https://launchpad.net/unity), [Cinnamon](https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon)
and [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) are supported. The currently running
desktop is detected using `$XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`.

### Supported players
By default pause-on-lock supports [Rhythmbox](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Rhythmbox)
and [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/download/linux/).
If you want support for more players, you can install [playerctl](https://github.com/acrisci/playerctl).
If playerctl is installed pause-on-lock supports all players that playerctl
can handle.


### Installation
You can download the [latest release](https://github.com/folixg/pause-on-lock/releases/latest)
either as deb-package or as source tarball.
In order to install the packages version run `sudo dpkg -i pause-on-lock_1.1-0ubuntu1.deb`,
this will install the binary to `/usr/bin/`.
If you don't want to use the packaged version, donwload the sources and put the
executable in a directory of your choosing.

### Usage
Simply run `pause-on-lock`, there is no further configuration needed.
I strongly recommend to add the pause-on-lock executable to [Startup Applications](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/startup-applications.html),
so it is run every time you log in.


Tested with Ubuntu 16.04, 17.04, 17.10 and 18.04.
